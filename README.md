How to use Dromote?
-------------------
You need Server and Client apps. Get them here:
*   [server](https://github.com/barnaba/Dromote/raw/master/dromote-server/dromote_standalone.py)
*   [client](https://github.com/barnaba/Dromote/raw/master/bin/dromote.apk)

Client has to be installed on your android device. As for the server just open your terminal and type:
    wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/barnaba/Dromote/raw/master/dromote-server/dromote_standalone.py
    python dromote_standalone.py
